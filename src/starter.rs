You see before yourself a long hallway with stairs at the end.
There is nothing in the way.

Tip: Call `warrior.walk()` in the `Player::play_turn` method.

It is too dark to see anything, but you smell sludge nearby.

Tip: Add a `rust_warrior::Tile` import and then call `warrior.check()`
to see if there is anything in front of you or if it's `Empty`. Call
`warrior.attack()` to fight the sludge.

```

The air feels thicker than before. There must be a horde of sludge.

Tip: Be careful not to die! Use `warrior.health()` to keep an eye on your health
and `warrior.rest()` to earn 10% of max health back.

```

You can hear bow strings being stretched.

Tip: No new abilities this time, but you must be careful not to rest while
taking damage. Add a `health` field to your `Player` struct and compare it on
each turn to see if you're taking damage.

You hear cries for help. Captives must need rescuing.

Tip: Add a `rust_warrior::UnitType` import and call `warrior.check()` to see
if there is a captive (`Tile::Unit(UnitType::Captive)`). Call
`warrior.rescue()` to rescue them. Don't attack captives.

```

The wall behind you feels a bit further away in this room. And you hear more
cries for help.

Tip: Add a `rust_warrior::Direction` import and use directional actions.
The directional action methods are `warrior.walk_toward(Direction)`,
`warrior.check_toward(Direction)`, `warrior.attack_toward(Direction)`,
and `warrior.rescue_toward(Direction)`. Archer attacks have a limited range.
Walk backward if you are taking damage from afar and don't have enough health
to engage. Consider backing up until you've reached a `Tile::Wall`.

You feel a wall right in front of you and an opening behind you.

Tip: You are not as effective at attacking backward. Use
`warrior.check_toward(Direction)` to see if you are facing a `Tile::Wall` and
`warrior.pivot()` to turn around.

You hear the mumbling of wizards. Beware of their deadly wands! Good thing you
found a bow and some arrows.

Tip: Use `warrior.look` to determine your surroundings, and `warrior.shoot` to
fire an arrow. Wizards are deadly but low in health. Kill them before they
have time to attack.
